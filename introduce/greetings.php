                Greetings everyone, this is Young Hoon Lee,<br>the chairman of Goodpeople NGO.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are living in an ever-changing world that surprises us daily. 
                Due to wars and natural disasters that are occurring throughout 
                the world, our neighbors are suffering from life-threatening dangers
                </p>
                <p>
                such as poverty, diseases, hunger, and etc. For the past 15 years, 
                we have gone around the world to meet the children who barely 
                have one meal each day to live on, people who have to walk 
                for hours to get a few drops of water, and people who see uncertain 
                tomorrow because they do not even have basic medicinal kit. We will 
                continue to love and reach out to those who are hungry, 
                sick, and in pain until every single one of them smile. 
                </p>
                <p>
                We ask for your continuous support in Goodpeople’s effort to raise 
                human value and spread hope in this world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chairman of corporation Goodpeople International,  <i>Young Hoon Lee</i>
                </p>
