                <h1>Education project</h1>
                <p> In order to break the vicious cycle of poverty and disease in underdeveloped countries, Goodpeople educates the residents about disease prevention and hygiene, ICT, language, art, music, and physical education. Through these educations, we develop human resources and businesses so that the community can build economic self-reliance and capability to improve independently.</p>
