                </div>
                <p>When North Korean defectors entered South Korean society, they faced multiple challenges such as maladjustment to capitalism, culture shock, internal trauma from defection. Goodpeople wanted to provide more than a mere support and strive to aid the defectors in successful settlement in South Korea. Therefore, Goodpeople founded educational facility that is specifically suited to the defectors, providing realistic, systemic, integrated education.</p>
